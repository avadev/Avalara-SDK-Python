```python
from Avalara.SDK.models.A1099.V2.job_response import JobResponse

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of JobResponse from a JSON string
job_response_instance = JobResponse.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(JobResponse.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
job_response_dict = job_response_instance.to_dict()
